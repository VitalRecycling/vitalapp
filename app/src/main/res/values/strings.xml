        being sent to Corpus Christi. If a bag of recyclables has any food or drink contamination, the entire batch is thrown away as garbage.\n\n
        From the Corpus Christi Recycling Center it is shipped to recycling plants so that the materials can be re-introduced into industrial production.
        Therefore we are only able to recycle materials that Corpus Christi recycles.*\n\n
        <b>Mixed paper:</b> newspaper, office paper, clean paper bags, paperboard boxes, etc.\n\n
